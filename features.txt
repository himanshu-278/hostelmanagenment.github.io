Project Description: Hostel Management System
This project is a C++ application designed to manage hostel bed reservations using a MySQL database. The application allows hostel administrators to interact with the system through a command-line interface, providing functionalities such as inserting hostel data, reserving beds for students, and checking the availability of beds.

Key Features:
Database Connectivity:

Establishes a connection to a MySQL database using credentials specified in the code (host, user, password, and database name).
Ensures error handling by displaying relevant error messages if the connection fails.
Hostel Class:

Represents a hostel with attributes such as Name, Bed (number of beds), and Fee (cost per bed).
Provides constructors for initializing these attributes and getter methods to retrieve their values.
Data Insertion:

Inserts a new hostel record into the database with predefined values for Name, Bed, and Fee.
Converts integer values to strings for the insertion query.
Displays success or error messages based on the outcome of the insertion operation.
User Interaction:

Presents a main menu with options to reserve a bed or exit the application.
Uses a loop to keep displaying the menu until the user decides to exit.
Clears the screen at the beginning of each loop iteration to provide a clean interface.
Bed Reservation:

Prompts the user to enter a student's name for reserving a bed.
Checks the current number of available beds in the specified hostel.
If beds are available, decreases the bed count by one and updates the database.
Displays a success message along with the fee amount.
If no beds are available, informs the user that no beds are currently available.
Exit Option:

Allows the user to exit the application, displaying a farewell message before terminating the program.
Error Handling:

Handles errors related to database connectivity, SQL queries, and invalid user inputs.
Ensures that appropriate error messages are displayed to the user for better understanding and debugging.
Workflow:
Database Connection:

The application initializes a MySQL connection and attempts to connect to the specified database.
If the connection is successful, it logs into the database and proceeds with further operations.
Hostel Record Insertion:

Creates a Hostel object with predefined attributes.
Constructs an SQL INSERT query to add the hostel data to the database.
Executes the query and handles any errors that may occur.
Main Menu Display:

Continuously displays a menu with options to reserve a bed or exit.
Processes user input to navigate through the menu options.
Bed Reservation Process:

Upon selecting the reservation option, the application prompts the user for the student's name.
Checks the availability of beds by querying the database.
If beds are available, updates the bed count in the database and displays a confirmation message.
If no beds are available, notifies the user.
Exit Process:

Allows the user to exit the application gracefully, displaying a "Good Luck" message before terminating the program.
Conclusion:
This Hostel Management System provides a simple yet functional interface for managing bed reservations in a hostel. It demonstrates the use of C++ for database interaction and user input handling, making it a useful tool for small-scale hostel management operations.
